## 1. Primary Strategic Focus

The explicit primary focus for V1.5 is:

**Operational Stability and Production Readiness**

This focus encompasses the following operational domains:

### 1.1 Operational Transparency
- **Review Archive** — Read-only, legally traceable decision history for completed and closed dossiers
- Corresponds to inventory item **1.1** (Review Archive)

### 1.2 Operational Control
- **Case assignment persistence** — Reliable tracking of case-to-worker assignments and workload distribution
- **Visit scheduling persistence** — Durable recording of scheduled and completed field visits
- Corresponds to inventory items **1.16** (Case Assignment Tracking) and **1.17** (Visit Schedule Persistence)

### 1.3 Admin Adoption
- **Dutch (NL) localization** of the administrative portal to support operational adoption by Dutch-speaking staff
- Corresponds to inventory item **1.7** (Admin Portal NL Localization)

### 1.4 System Robustness
- **Scale Pack A** — Server-side pagination for admin listings
- **Scale Pack B** — Database-level KPI aggregations for dashboards
- **Scale Pack C** — Async search for form selectors with large datasets
- Corresponds to inventory items **1.8** (Scale Pack A), **1.9** (Scale Pack B), and **1.9** (Scale Pack C)

## 2. Explicit De-Prioritization

The following items are **NOT PRIMARY** for V1.5. They remain in the inventory for future planning but are **not candidates for V1.5 scope**:

| Item  | Description                                              | V1.5 Status |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1.3   | Financial Assessment Service Formalization               | Deferred    |
| 1.4   | Subsidy Allocation Formal Workflow                       | Deferred    |
| 1.11  | Approved Amount Editing by Minister                      | Deferred    |
| 1.15  | External Financial Processing (Outside DVH-IMS Boundary) | Deferred    |

These items are explicitly excluded from V1.5 primary scope. Their inclusion in a future release requires separate authorization.

## 3. Proposed Phase Direction

The following is a **conceptual grouping only**. No design, schema, workflow, or UI specification is implied.

### Phase 1: Operational Transparency (Archive)
- Review Archive UI for completed/closed dossiers
- PDF report generation for decision summaries
- Role-scoped read-only access for oversight roles

### Phase 2: Operational Control (Assignments)
- Persistent case-to-worker assignment tracking
- Visit scheduling persistence
- Integration with existing V1.4 field work interfaces

### Phase 3: Adoption and Scale Readiness
- Admin Portal NL localization
- Scale Pack A (server-side pagination)
- Scale Pack B (dashboard KPI aggregations)
- Scale Pack C (form selector async search)

## 4. Governance Confirmation

- No implementation is proposed in this document
- No prioritization implies approval
- All items remain subject to formal authorization by the designated authority
- Each phase requires individual authorization before execution may begin
- This document serves as a strategic intake direction only
